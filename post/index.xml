      <description>Hello, world!&#xA;Another year, another website, another blog. Happy 2022.&#xA;I&amp;rsquo;ve had the same black-and-white home page for as long as I&amp;rsquo;ve been a professor, so more than fifteen years. This new-and-improved version has a few tiny splashes of color and, more importantly, it is responsive. But in its minimalism, it&amp;rsquo;s very much the spiritual successor to my prior page.&#xA;The biggest change is under the hood: no longer is this just a bunch of hand-edited HTML.</description>
