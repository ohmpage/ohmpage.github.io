      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another year, another website, another blog. Happy 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had the same black-and-white home page for as long as I&amp;rsquo;ve been a professor, so more than fifteen years. This new-and-improved version has a few tiny splashes of color and, more importantly, it is &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design&#34;&gt;responsive&lt;/a&gt;. But in its minimalism, it&amp;rsquo;s very much the spiritual successor to my prior page.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The biggest change is under the hood: no longer is this just a bunch of hand-edited HTML. It&amp;rsquo;s now a bunch of mostly hand-edited Hugo templates. Just as significant, I&amp;rsquo;m finally retiring the web hosting provider I have had for more than twenty years, using the free service provided by GitHub pages. Fingers crossed that Microsoft doesn&amp;rsquo;t screw this up!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
